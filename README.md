# Welcome

This repository is made to prepare for the upcoming exam on April 2025 and you may clone this repo if you wish but this is merely my personal study repo. Please don't expect that this repo will be formatted to cater to your understanding. However, I will be sharing with you some files I use for reviewing in the **/Resources** folder.

### Setup
Clone the repo using the following command into your preferred file directory.
```
git clone  https://github.com/Bobberns/Bobbys-PhilNITS-Grind.git
```
### Suggestions
- Open the repo in an Obsidian vault.
- Theme: Typewriter by crashmoney (dark mode)
- Apply the following lines of codes in your **custom.css** file
```
.markdown-preview-view img {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  border-radius: 4px;
  mix-blend-mode: lighten;
  opacity: 0.5;
}
```

### Plugins

### Collaboration
As of now, I will **NOT** make this repository collaborative. Maybe in the future I will.
